#Write a program that prompts the user to enter only the dollar amount (no cents) of an item less than or equal to 50 dollars.
#Assume the customer is paying with a 50 dollar bill. Store that amount in a properly named constant as an integer.
#Assume that no tax and no other fees are being applied.
#The program should give change with the largest bills possible, starting with 20's, then 10's then 5's, then finally ones.
#Review the Python math operators on page 54 and use f_string printing.
#Ensure that your program's output is formatted as identified in the example output below.

#Bills dispensed as change:
#$20 - 0
#$10 - 1
#$5 - 1
#$1 - 1
